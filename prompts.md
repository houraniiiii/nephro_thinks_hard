#1 
You need to generate one complex question based on the given text content. These questions can be open-ended, detail-oriented, case-veginette or related to a broader discussion of the content, but avoid relying on specific case details from the text. Follow these requirements:
 
Requirements:
 
1. Make sure the question is closely related to the main points or themes mentioned in the text.
 
2. Ensure the two questions are as diverse as possible, avoiding homogeneity.
 
3. Ensure the questions include all the information needed for the answers. If necessary, add introductory information to the questions.
 
4. Avoid repetitive or overly simplistic question, ensuring diversity and depth.
 
5. The questions must be self-contained and should not require the provided text as background to be understood.
 
Please rewrite the following text into related question, and strictly follow the format below for output:
 
{
 
       "question": "Generated question"
 
}
 
Here is the sample text:

#2
You need to generate one complex clinical reasoning question based on the given text content. The question must be self-contained and should not rely on the source text to be understood. Use an internal medicine or nephrology angle whenever possible.

Requirements:

1. Focus on multi-step reasoning (differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, diagnostic strategy, or management decision).
2. Incorporate key concepts or themes from the text but avoid copying case details verbatim.
3. Provide all necessary context within the question (include pertinent history, labs, and/or imaging if needed).
4. Keep the question specific and challenging, not generic or trivial.
5. Output a single question only.

Please rewrite the following text into a related question, and strictly follow the format below for output:

{
  "question": "Generated question"
}

Here is the sample text:

#3
You need to generate one complex evidence-to-decision question based on the given text content. The question must be self-contained and should not rely on the source text to be understood. Prefer internal medicine or nephrology framing.

Requirements:

1. Anchor the question in clinical evidence (trial, cohort, meta-analysis, or guideline-level reasoning).
2. Include enough study context (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes) to allow a reasoned answer.
3. Force a nuanced decision (benefit vs harm, subgroup applicability, bias, confounding, or external validity).
4. Avoid over-simplified questions; make it require true clinical reasoning.
5. Output a single question only.

Please rewrite the following text into a related question, and strictly follow the format below for output:

{
  "question": "Generated question"
}

Here is the sample text:

#4
You need to generate one complex nephrology-leaning internal medicine question based on the given text content. The question must be self-contained and should not rely on the source text to be understood.

Requirements:

1. Emphasize renal physiology, pathology, diagnosis, treatment, acid-base/electrolytes, AKI/CKD, or systemic disease with kidney involvement when possible.
2. Require multi-step reasoning (e.g., mechanism-to-management, diagnosis-to-therapy, risk stratification).
3. Provide all necessary clinical details within the question.
4. Avoid copying specific case details; generalize if needed.
5. Output a single question only.

Please rewrite the following text into a related question, and strictly follow the format below for output:

{
  "question": "Generated question"
}
